# crossword-now

A Nodejs powered Slack bot in two parts built for Bluemix. A slash command and an incoming webhook to deliver crosswords for your Slack team.

Based on the work of David Amey.

## Configure Environment Variables

Since Bluemix is essentially Cloud Foundry under the covers this should work for Cloud Foundry too. I haven't tested on other platforms so results may vary.

TODO after PouchDB and Promises updates.
